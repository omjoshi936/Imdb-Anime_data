# Imdb-Anime_data
This GitHub repository contains a data science project that focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset related to Japanese animations (Anime) listed on IMDb. The dataset provides valuable insights into various aspects of these animations, including user ratings, genre, runtime, and more. It's important to note that the dataset also includes animations that may not be considered Japanese Anime, such as "Toy Story".

# Tools Used:

1. NumPy: We leveraged NumPy for efficient data manipulation, including array operations and data cleaning.

2. Pandas: Pandas played a crucial role in data handling, allowing us to perform data transformations, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis with ease.

3. scikit-learn (sklearn): For machine learning tasks, scikit-learn was employed to build and evaluate predictive models, as well as for feature engineering.

4. Seaborn: We utilized Seaborn for data visualization, creating informative plots and charts to visually explore trends and patterns within the dataset.

5. Matplotlib: Matplotlib was used in conjunction with Seaborn to customize and fine-tune our data visualizations for clear and effective communication.

# Project Goals:
As a student, this project aimed to showcase proficiency in data cleaning and analysis. The primary objectives included:

1. Data Cleaning: We thoroughly cleaned the dataset to ensure data integrity, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through visualizations and statistical summaries, we explored the dataset to uncover interesting insights about Japanese Anime on IMDb.

3. Machine Learning: We applied machine learning techniques to predict user ratings and evaluate the factors influencing them.
